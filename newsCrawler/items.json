      "The final goal of such sustained efforts is to destroy faith in institutions, thereby\u00a0destroying entire countries from within by creating an environment in which the fundamental trust between individuals and governments necessary for social cohesion in liberal democracies can no longer exist. From this perspective, these ongoing denials of the reality of the election\u2019s results can be viewed not simply as one man lashing out in denial as enablers look on, but\u00a0",
      " against the American people and their long-cherished democratic systems, using social media platforms and their algorithms as both vehicles and enthusiastic enablers for disinformation campaigns.",
      "Whatever their motivations, the way to counteract these threats remains the same. Hybrid threats can be countered by ",
      " \u2014 in other words, creating and strengthening national (and international) responses to disinformation campaigns and attacks from the ground up with a combination of vetted, credible, transparent actions by institutions, strong and independent journalism unfettered by government censorship or political intimidation, and an overall refusal by individuals and entire institutions to cave to lies uttered by bad-faith bullies. Without resilience and clarity, there is no democracy at all."

      "According to intelligence sources US Military raided voting machine company Scytl servers in Germany for evidence of manipulation in 2020 US Elections after it was exposed in vote switching scandal by GreatGameIndia. Scytl has a long history of election fraud in various nations including injecting backdoors in its election software. The issue has prompted experts to question why the sensitive job of counting votes was outsourced to a foreign company? How could a bankrupted Spanish company Scytl count American votes in Spain?",
      "According to Congressman Louie Gohmert, Texas there is \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d of vote switching in the 2020 presidential election compiled by the Spanish electronic voting machine company Scytl.",
      "The Texas lawmaker said in an interview with Newsmax TV that US military forces seized the company\u2019s server in Frankfurt, Germany. Gohmert said there are some who believe it\u2019s U.S. intelligence \u201cthat manipulated all this\u201d to cover themselves.",
      "Gohmert\u2019s source? Unknown:",
      "In a Facebook conference call, Gohmert elaborated that he received the information Sunday from \u201csome of our former intel people that there was extremely compelling evidence that could be gleaned from Scytl,\u201d the Barcelona company that was \u201cresponsible for aggregating all the information from all the machines.\u201d",
      "If the map Ananatmula shared was part of GreatGameIndia.com\u2019s post, it was removed; the only reference to 410 electoral votes for Trump was in an extensive comments section. The map was generated on 270towin.com, a site on which anyone can generate any Electoral College result. Incidentally, GreatGameIndia.com was assessed by NewsGuard [",
      "], which found that the site frequently spreads false and unvetted claims.",
      "It seems likely that Anantatumula created the map to illustrate a Trump landslide; we took that a step further, and created a different \u201cTrump landslide\u201d map in roughly 90 seconds:",
      "Any user-generated map from 270towin.com was not a predictor of any sort of data or official result. On November 17 2020, the map displayed by default was closer (but not identical) to the final result:",

      "CLAIM: The U.S. Army raided the Frankfurt office of the Spanish election software company Scytl to seize servers that had evidence of voting irregularities in the Nov. 3 U.S. election.",
      "AP\u2019S ASSESSMENT: False. Both the Army and Scytl told The Associated Press the claim is not true. Furthermore, Scytl does not have offices or servers in Frankfurt, Germany.",
      "THE FACTS: Social media users Saturday were sharing reports published by conservative websites claiming servers that would reveal wrongdoing in the U.S. election had been confiscated by U.S. military forces in Germany. Most posts said the servers belong to the software company Scytl, which is based in Barcelona, and some suggested the servers housed information from Dominion Voting Systems.",
      "Gohmert was also quoted in a much more comprehensive fashion by the AP than by OANN:",
      "In his remarks, which were widely shared on social media, Gohmert acknowledged that the information about the alleged raid only came from a \u201cGerman tweet in German,\u201d and he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know the truth.\u201d",
      "To recap, OANN spread the claim Trump won 410 electoral votes to Biden\u2019s 128, obscuring the source for that claim. The sources were, apparently,\u00a0Anantatumula, Gohmert, and a customizable electoral map.\u00a0Anantatumula appeared to create a map to visually support these claims, but that map was generated on 270towin.com, not a server found in Germany or Spain. Sctyl and the Army addressed the claims, confirming that are completely false. As of November 17 2020, Trump had received 232 electoral votes to Joe Biden\u2019s 290, making Trump\u2019s electoral defeat as decisive as his popular vote loss."

Data forensic experts use these distributions to investigate fraud. They look at whether empirical distributions of leading digits deviate from a special distribution described by Benford\u2019s Law.

If a candidate has roughly the same level of support in all the precincts, which means the candidate\u2019s share of the votes is roughly the same in all the precincts, then the vote counts will have the same first digit in all of the precincts.

It was illustrated in Aitken\u2019s Principles of Midwifery or Puerperal Medicine (1785) and used by him in his dissecting room. Jeffray claimed to have conceived the idea of the chain saw independently about that time but it was 1790 before he was able to have it produced. In 1806, Jeffray published Cases of the Excision of Carious Joints by H. Park and P. F. Moreau with Observations by James Jeffray M.D.. In this communication he translated Moreau\u2019s paper of 1803. Park and Moreau described successful excision of diseased joints, particularly the knee and elbow. Jeffray explained that the chain saw would allow a smaller wound and protect the adjacent neurovascular bundle. ",

The phrasing didn\u2019t really provide any clues with respect to how often childbirth involved use of the prototype chainsaw to which the literature alluded.",

      "In addition to an illustration of Aitken\u2019s \u201cchainsaw\u201d (indicating it was nothing like the motorized version with which most people are familiar), a partial letter by an unidentified person described how Aitken had designed \u201ca mobile saw, that used a linked clock chain with serrations cut into one side; this was passed behind the symphisis [a place where bones are closely joined; \u2018a compressable fibrocartilaginous pad that connects two bones\u2019] and pulled outwards, and from side to side, bimanually\u201d:",
      "The letter writer went on to assert that Aitken\u2019s\u00a0",
      " \u201cchain saw\u201d was displaced by a similar bone saw, before \u201cthe forestry industry mechanized the surgical chain saw for tree felling.\u201d In other words, the item nearly all people understood to be a \u201cchainsaw\u201d was not mechanized, and the version with which we are acquainted was in fact developed by the forestry industry.",

      "Further investigation suggested the \u201cchainsaw\u201d described was handheld and not motorized, and somewhat rarely used in childbirth; the nebulous text of the abstract and Wikipedia article made it easy to accept the \u201cfun fact\u201d that chainsaws were invented for childbirth.

      "The 1920s extended the hairless ideal of the armpits to the legs as well. Hemlines rose on skirts and dresses from 1910\u20131927.

Between 1942\u20131945, the War Production Board imposed further limits on cosmetic manufacturing, including leg makeup, taxing cosmetics as much as 20%.[3] The norm to remove leg hair for women became very strong in the 1940s, more specifically, it moved from fad to custom in a matter of months in the early 1940s.[3] A later survey, in 1964, indicated that 98% of American women aged 15\u201344 routinely shaved their legs.",

      "During the 1920s, knee-high skirts made legs more visible, and depilatory companies wasted no time claiming that their products enabled \u201ca woman to bathe stockingless, without self-consciousness.\u201d",

      "Briefly, it even seemed like depilatories might just be a passing fad. From 1924 to 1926, ads for them disappeared from the Sears catalog and McCall\u2019s. And most of the ads were seasonal, running from around April to September \u2014 timing that suggests women mostly relegated hair removal to summer, when their underarms and legs were exposed.",
      "That didn\u2019t last.",
      "By the 1940s, leg hair removal had become standard. By this point, all of the hair removal ads in Harper\u2019s Bazar mentioned leg hair, and 56 percent focused on the legs alone, according to Hope.",
      "As for pre-1915 body hair removal, a May 2019 article about body hair in art history explained:",
      "More recently, female body hair has gained a political resonance as many women today forego shaving as a feminist or fashion statement \u2026 Still, archaic ideas around body hair remain hard to break. ",
      " Female body hair was considered barbaric, uncivilized, or low-class in Greek culture. ",
      "Historian Alice Macdonald observes that in Greek art, the \u201csmooth marble bodies\u201d of their sculptures, \u201cwhether hairless because of artistic censure or because they reflected the social custom of depilation\u2014have over the centuries structured the cultural imagination in such a way as to make the glabrous female body an entrenched and irresistible feminine aesthetic.\u201d By contrast, male nudes from the same period have hairless chests, but unlike their female counterparts, sport stylized pubic hair.",
      "[\u2026]",
      "Artists from the [second half of the 19th century] who engaged with the fashionable but problematic trend of Orientalism, like Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres and Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me, applied Western beauty ideals of hairlessness to their exoticizing pictures of Middle Eastern and North African women. They delighted in the opportunity to portray these figures as literal sex objects\u2014nude in the bathhouse of a harem (The Turkish Bath, 1862) or on the auction block as a sex slave (Slave Market, 1866). ",
      "In short, the claim that women began shaving due to a razor company (Gillette)\u2019s decision to \u201csell more\u201d razors in 1915 harbored a follicle (get it?) of truth, but the actual history of hair removal in and outside the United States was far more nuanced and far ranging. Intentional removal of body hair spanned cultures and millennia in human history, as evidenced by much of the history of art. Shaving was indeed less common when women were unlikely to bare their legs or underarms, gradually phasing in as part of grooming when sleeveless dresses and shorter hems appeared. World War II\u2019s shortage of nylon appeared to solidify regular shaving of legs among women in Allied nations, and the trend stuck."

      "It didn\u2019t get any better from there:",
      "Throughout the entire interview, Isaac switched back and forth from saying he reached out to law enforcement after viewing the files in the laptop to saying that it was actually the Federal Bureau of Investigation that reached out to him. At one point, Isaac claimed that he was emailing someone from the FBI about the laptop. At another point he claimed a special agent from the Baltimore office had contacted him after he alerted the FBI to the device\u2019s existence. At another point, he said the FBI reached out to him for \u201chelp accessing his drive.\u201d",
      "Isaac referenced the infamous Seth Rich conspiracy theory\u2014which holds that a DNC staffer who police say was murdered in a botched robbery was actually killed off by Clinton allies because he leaked committee emails\u2014as reason for his paranoia. He said he made a copy of the hard drive for purposes of personal protection.",
      "Isaac then refused to answer questions about whether he had any sort of history with Rudy Giuliani:",
      "\u00a0Pressed on his relationship with Giuliani, he replied: \u201cWhen you\u2019re afraid and you don\u2019t know anything about the depth of the waters that you\u2019re in, you want to find a lifeguard.\u201d",

      "So, Rudy was your lifeguard, the reporters asked. \u201cNo comment,\u201d he replied.",
      "It remains unclear whose laptop this actually was, how it came to be dropped off at the Maryland computer store in April 2019, whether the emails and other materials found on it are indeed legitimate, or whether more \u201cOctober Surprises\u201d will follow. However, one thing is clear: The ",

      "That fact-check largely had to do with the additional stipulation that all living presidents had disavowed Trump, noting that in 2016, United States Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush each withheld endorsements. Reuters noted that the claim dated back to 2016 and was revived in 2020, and that it was possible that the rumor that Trump was the only incumbent not to receive any endorsements from living predecessors originated with that early \u2014 but not identical \u2014 claim.",

      "Unsurprisingly and likely due to advances in medicine, three of the four periods when six former presidents still lived were fairly recent. After the period of March 1861 through January 1862, the successive periods began in 1993, 2001, and 2017.",
      "As evidenced by that list, one need not go back all the way to Washington to find examples of times when few or no living former presidents were available to endorse an incumbent. Following Washington, presidents with no living predecessors included John Adams, Ulysses S. Grant, Teddy Roosevelt, Herbert Hoover, and Richard Nixon. Three of those six presidents absent a predecessor served in the 20th century, up to the fairly recent administration of Nixon.",
      "Once again, the matter could be construed as one of technical truth or semantics; six presidents had no living former presidents available to endorse them. Conversely, an argument could be made for whether Trump was unique in an absence of endorsements by predecessors in 2016 and 2020.",
      "Many Americans were familiar with the musical Hamilton, and a ",
      " in the second act, \u201cThe Election of 1800,\u201d about Hamilton\u2019s decision to vocally support Thomas Jefferson, who would go on to become the United States\u2019 third president.",
      "The 1800 elections were the\u00a0",

      "Through private letters and meetings, leaders of the two major factions, the Federalists and the Republicans, chose their candidates for the election of 1800. For the first time, Congressmen for each political party met to nominate candidates. The Federalists selected John Adams and Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, while the Republicans put forward Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr. ",
      " Activists of opposing parties often used vehement name calling and smear tactics against Adams and Jefferson. The Constitution did not distinguish between candidates for the presidency and vice presidency. As a result, when each Democratic-Republican elector cast his two votes for Jefferson and Burr, the result was a tie (each man got 73 votes). John Adams received 65 votes and Pinckney 64. For the first time, the House of Representatives was called upon to decide a presidential election. After 35 ballots, however, it still had not chosen a president. ",
      "We found no specific point at which endorsements from former presidents became a norm, but information from the Library of Congress ",
      " that no such endorsements likely took place in 1920, when the only two living presidents were Woodrow Wilson and William Howard Taft:",
      "For the first time in a generation the party had no recognized leader such as Grover Cleveland, William Jennings Bryan or Woodrow Wilson. Retiring President Wilson\u2019s refusal to endorse a candidate prevented the emergence of any one candidate as the front-runner.",

At least six sitting presidents had no living predecessors at the time they sought re-election, and could not have possibly secured any endorsements. Finally, the historical relevance of endorsements from former presidents was viewed in the meme through a fairly modern lens, when records of notable election year endorsements were fairly scattershot throughout much of American history."

      "When I ask Parton if she ever thought she\u2019d be impacting runways like this, she says, laughing, \u201cGod, no. To me, that\u2019s still one of the funniest things, when people say that I am a fashion icon. I just always thought people thought I was so gaudy. I am! I\u2019m flashy, and I\u2019m flamboyant. Had I not been a girl, I definitely would have been a drag queen. I like all that flamboyance.

When I\u2019m around home, I wear my little scrunchies, but I always put on some makeup and fix my own hair as cute as I can fix it. Wigs are just so handy. I\u2019m so busy, and I have so many choices. I never have a bad hair day, and that\u2019s a good thing.",
      "It seemed a pattern emerged in interviews with Parton, in which she acknowledged habits like wearing wigs, but did not disclose much more than that. Parton was consistently candid about her love of big hair, wigs, ostentatious clothing, heavy makeup, and cosmetic procedures \u2014 but she didn\u2019t offer up information about her appearance without wigs or makeup. And again, that reticence tacitly supported the idea she might leverage a lack of makeup or a wigless ensemble to quietly go out and about.",
      "On the other hand, it is strange that in the age of smartphones and viral social media posts, it truly appears that no one has managed to obtain photographs of Parton definitively without makeup or a wig. Searches for Parton not wearing makeup or not wearing a wig were largely not fruitful, primarily returning images of Parton as we know her to be, or vintage ",
      " dating back thirty years or more.",
      "A viral tweet about Dolly Parton\u2019s fame-averse husband and largely quiet marriage led to discussions suggesting that the star favored her \u201creal hair\u201d and \u201cmore typical middle aged southern lady outfits,\u201d enabling her to \u201cjust Clark [Kent] her way into maintaining a private life.\u201d Parton openly discussed her husband Carl Dean\u2019s strong recoil from the spotlight, and separately, she referenced attempts to go \u201cincognito\u201d in public \u2014 alongside consequent denials she could pull off hiding in plain sight. In any event, we were unable to locate images of Parton deviating greatly from her signature style (or any in which she definitively did not wear a wig); Parton said she \u201cdid her roots\u201d for her husband, but did not specify whether or not her natural hair color was blonde. As such, the claim is partly true (Dean avoids fame), and partly unknown \u2014 in other words, mixed."

While the footage is loading on the TV, it cuts back to regular programming for 10 seconds. What is shows is this, from 0:05-0:15 and it is honestly chilling. I can\u2019t stop thinking about it. It shows the fetus being blown up as the heart attached to it exploded (aka the mom being killed) and then shows oil seeping out of a skeleton?!!? SERIOUSLY, what are the chances that in the 10 seconds it took for the camera to load that THIS is what it shows. There\u2019s no way this is just a coincidence.

      "In 22 states, the prosecutor must obtain an indictment before he can proceed with a felony prosecution, and while it sounds like a fancy legal term, don\u2019t be fooled \u2014 indictments are easy to obtain.",
      "They can come pre- or post-arrest. Pre-arrest indictments (rare in New York) are generally based on weeks or even months of investigation, material discovered through search warrants, phone taps, and snitch information \u2014 more akin to what\u2019s traditionally done in a federal, rather than a state, case. (Reminder: If you or a loved one ever is the subject of such an investigation, do not cooperate without an attorney present. Even as a witness subpoened to a grand jury, you have the right to an attorney.)",

There\u2019s no judge, no defense attorney, and generally a defendant only testifies in rare circumstances \u2014 his story is so air tight that there\u2019s no down side in putting him in. There\u2019s no necessity for unanimity among the 23 or so jurors, and the standard of proof is so low \u2014 that probable cause exists to believe a crime has been committed \u2014 anyone, for the merest hint of an offense, can get indicted.",
      "On October 6 2020, legal scholar Eugene Volokh published a brief assessment of the Netflix\u00a0",
      " indictment, essentially ",
      " it as, at the very least, stunt-adjacent:",
      "[Eugene Volokh] Indictment Netflix Under Texas Child Pornography Law Probably Won't Go Anywhere ",
      " ",
      "\u2014 Volokh Conspiracy (@VolokhC) ",
      "In a short piece (\u201cIndictment of Netflix Under Texas Child Pornography Law Probably Won\u2019t Go Anywhere\u201d), Volokh wrote in part:",
      "I think Netflix should easily beat this indictment because Texas law expressly excludes material that has \u201cserious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value \u2026 The judgment about serious value in such contexts is generally seen as being, in the first instance, a matter of law for the judge (and for appellate judges); it\u2019s to be judged under a national reasonable person standard, and not under a community standard. (See Pope v. Illinois (1987).) And of course a work can have serious artistic value regardless of its moral message; and serious value is not a particularly high bar.",
      "From all I hear about Cuties (I haven\u2019t watched it myself), it does have serious artistic value, and it seems unlikely that a court would conclude that a film that won a Best Director prize (in the international film category) at Sundance lacks such value. To be sure, in Castillo v. State (Tex. Ct. App. 2002), the court was a bit cavalier as to the serious value inquiry when it came to a comic book, and left the matter to the jury\u2019s discretion. But given the Pope precedent, coupled with the film\u2019s awards and nominations (and perhaps, rightly or wrongly, the sense that broadly exhibited films are more \u201cartistic[ally]\u201d \u201cserious\u201d than comic books), I don\u2019t think Netflix has much to worry about here.",
      "In a subsequent point, Volokh noted that states likely could prohibit lewd material involving children regardless of what is arguably artistic merit:",
      "Now it appears that a state probably could ban child pornography without regard to whether it has serious value: In the words of the Supreme Court in Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition (2002),",
      "Where the images are themselves the product of child sexual abuse, \u2026 the State ha[s] an interest in stamping it out without regard to any judgment about its content\u2026. The fact that a work contained serious literary, artistic, or other value [does] not excuse the harm it caused to its child participants.",

      "You\u2019ve mentioned earlier, Vice President Pence, that the president was committed to maintaining protections for people with pre-existing conditions, but you do have this court case that you are supporting, your administration supporting that would strike down the Affordable Care Act. The president says, President Trump says that he\u2019s going to protect people with preexisting conditions, but he has not explained how he would do that, and that was one of the toughest nuts to crack when they were passing the Affordable Care Act. So, tell us specifically, how would your administration protect Americans with preexisting conditions to have access to affordable insurance if the Affordable Care Act is struck down?",
      "Pence responded by pivoting to abortion before segueing to the vacant Supreme Court seat and efforts to confirm a replacement for Ginsburg before the election. In his allotted two minutes, Pence posed a question to Harris about whether she and former Vice President Joe Biden planned to \u201cpack the [Supreme Court]\u201d with additional judges should Amy Coney Barrett be confirmed prior to the election:",
      "Well, thank you, Susan, but let me just say, addressing your very first question. I couldn\u2019t be more proud to serve as vice president to a president who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life. I\u2019m pro-life. I don\u2019t apologize for it, and this is another one of those cases where there\u2019s such a dramatic contrast. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris support taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth. Late term abortion. They want to increase funding to Planned Parenthood of America.",
      "Presidents have nominated in all 29 cases, but your party is actually openly advocating, adding seats to the Supreme court, which has had nine seats for 150 years if you don\u2019t get your way.

      "No, you\u2019ve refused to answer the question. Joe Biden has refused to answer the question. ",

      " was indeed an election year, and an incumbent President Abraham Lincoln (National Union Party) ran against\u00a0George Brinton McClellan (Democratic Party) and\u00a0Ellsworth Cheeseborough (independent).",
      "Election Day was November 8 1864; Lincoln won with 55 percent of the popular vote. On October 12 1864, Supreme Court Justice Roger Taney died. At the time of Taney\u2019s death, he was a member of the Democratic Party:",
      "Taney died on October 12, 1864, at the age of 87 [on] the same day his home state of Maryland passed an amendment abolishing slavery. The following morning, the clerk of the Supreme Court announced that \u201cthe great and good Chief Justice is no more.\u201d He served as chief justice for 28 years, 198 days, the second longest tenure of any chief justice, and was the oldest ever serving Chief Justice in United States history \u2026",
      " Lincoln and three members of his cabinet \u2014 Secretary of State William H. Seward, Attorney General Edward Bates, and Postmaster General William Dennison \u2014 attended Taney\u2019s memorial service in Washington. Only Bates joined the cort\u00e8ge to Frederick, Maryland for Taney\u2019s funeral and burial at St. John the Evangelist Cemetery.",
      "As noted above, Taney (a Democrat) was ",
      " by Salmon Chase, a Lincoln appointee:",
      "In June 1864, Lincoln surprised Chase by accepting his fourth offer of resignation. The Republican Party had at that point already nominated Lincoln as its presidential candidate and the Treasury was in solid shape, so Lincoln no longer needed to keep Chase in the cabinet to forestall a challenge for the presidential nomination. But to placate the Radical wing of the party, Lincoln mentioned Chase as a potential Supreme Court nominee.",
      "Chase\u2019s political affiliation changed over the years:",
      "Per PolitiFact, Taney ",
      " 27 days before the Election of 1864. Ginsburg died on September 18 2020, 46 days before the 2020 Election. To date, Taney\u2019s death on the bench was historically the closest in proximity to a looming election. By all accounts, Lincoln\u2019s post-election appointment of Chase was a far less pressing issue due to the fact the Civil War did not end until 1865.",
      "A law review article from 1981 [",
      "] cited by PolitiFact addressed the political climate at the time of the 1864 election, as well as the dynamic between Chase and Lincoln:",
      "During the campaign Roger B. Taney, Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, died. His death on October 12 required Lincoln to replace a jurist who had served on the Court for twenty-eight years. The President was not without candidates. Associate Supreme Court Justice Noah Swayne and Postmaster-General Montgomery Blair both vied for the position. Senator Charles Sumner supported Chase and along with other Republicans urged his appointment. Chase, who had as early as 1863 indicated his interest in the Chief Justice position, would not openly solicit the appointment. He did, however, write Sumner that he would accept it if it were offered and Sumner showed this letter to the President. Lincoln delayed the appointment until after the election. On December 6, he sent Chase\u2019s nomination to the Senate where it was unanimously approved. Seven days later Salmon Portland Chase was sworn in as the sixth Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court.",
      "An often repeated theory about Salmon Chase is that Lincoln appointed him to the Supreme Court to neutralize him as a presidential rival. This seems unfeasible. Chase\u2019s threat to Lincoln in 1864 was totally non-existent by the time of Taney\u2019s death. A threat four years hence was also unrealistic. In addition to the question of Lincoln\u2019s seeking a third term, Chase had never proved a really viable opponent earlier when he was at the height of his political career. In both 1860 and 1864, he had failed to organize an effective campaign and to gain the support of significant party vote-getters. To appoint Chase to the Supreme Court, therefore, would have been an unnecessary political tactic. A better explanation is that Lincoln understood and appreciated Chase. He knew Chase to be consistently loyal to his own principles, especially in his attitude toward slavery and the rights of the black man, and to be religiously conscientious. Unfortunately, this understanding was notably one-sided. After years of much official and some personal association, Chase wrote about the President in his diary: \u201cI feel that I do not know him.\u201d",
      "Like Ginsburg, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died in an election year (2016); and as in 2020, partisan squabbling over the vacancy centered on the election\u2019s outcome and the future of the court. By contrast, Taney\u2019s bench vacancy did not appear to be in any way similar, as Lincoln appeared to quietly wait until December 1864 to appoint Chase. A post-debate ",
      " ",
      " about Harris\u2019 \u201clittle history lesson\u201d noted:",
      "Lincoln was, of course, reelected. And the day after the Senate was back in session, he nominated Chase for chief justice. He hoped the august appointment would \u201cneutralize\u201d Chase\u2019s designs on the presidency. (It didn\u2019t.)",
      "So Harris is mistaken about Lincoln\u2019s motivations in this regard. But there\u2019s one thing Lincoln definitely supported that Harris has yet to weigh in on: court-packing.",
      "PolitiFact assigned somewhat different motives to Lincoln\u2019s political machinations, concluding:",
      "The Biden campaign pointed PolitiFact to a tweet during the debate by historian Michael Beschloss \u2026 Two historians we contacted weren\u2019t convinced.",
      "Burlingame suggested Lincoln\u2019s move was a combination of risk-aversion and logistical concerns.",
      "\u201cHe evidently did not want to antagonize conservatives during the campaign,\u201d Burlingame said. \u201cCongress was out of session and not scheduled to reconvene until early December [1864]. ",
      " Besides, members of Congress were busy stumping for their own candidacies.\u201d",
      "All that analysis made one thing clear \u2014 regardless of the known timeline between Taney\u2019s death, the election of 1864, and Chase\u2019s appointment \u2014 there was no evidence of any statement made by Lincoln about waiting to fill the seat. Even when they were in disagreement about his motives, historians concurred that Lincoln was almost certainly unlikely to disclose his reasoning or even acknowledge the proximity of Taney\u2019s death to the election as he \u201ckept his cards close to the vest.\u201d",
      "During the October 7 2020 debate between Harris and Pence, Harris quoted Abraham Lincoln (or \u201cHonest Abe\u201d) as saying of filling the Supreme Court vacancy caused by Taney\u2019s 1864 death prior to the election:",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not the right thing to do. The American people deserve to make the decision about who will be the next president of the United States. And then that person can select who will serve for a lifetime on the highest court of our land.\u201d",
      "Although it\u2019s historically true Taney died 27 days before Lincoln\u2019s 1864 re-election, there is no record he that made any public statement about the vacancy, election, or even deferred Chase\u2019s appointment for the specific reason of a pending loss. Lincoln won the election handily, and Congress was not in session until December 1864.",
      "Historians speculate on Lincoln\u2019s political strategy and even suggested that he might appoint Chase in a \u201clame duck\u201d scenario, but the claim that Lincoln said outright or even publicly implied that it was a decision that the American people deserved to make about a new appointee is not supported by historical accounts; however, as historians have noted, there is no definitive answer about his motives."
